# Evening Kickoff

## Before student presentation

### 6:15pm (or any time during dinner)

Find the student and let them know to meet you at 6:25pm at the podium in the lecture area to get set up.

### 6:20pm

Set up the space:
* Turn on the three handheld mics and the headset mic (for the headset, flick the switch so the green light turns on)
* Distribute two handheld mics to the audience (one in camping chairs, one at back tables), and keep the remaining handheld mic and the headset mic on the podium
* Click the down arrow on the wall switch, to bring the projector screen down
* Turn on the projector (little white remote, just press the power button once)
* Close all blinds, behind the projector and across from the projector (near the senior tables)
* If it's Friday, have the 5-Minute Presentations spreadsheet open on your laptop so you're ready to take sign-ups after the presentation.

### 6:25pm

Set the student up:
* Get the student's laptop plugged in, such that their slides show up on the projector screen. If this does not happen after about 30 seconds, make sure the black cord from the podium is fully plugged into the wall outlet. If this does not work, find Space Ops or another staff member asap.
* Offer the student the clicker/laser pointer, if they want it. If so, they have to plug in the USB piece to their computer. This will bring up a pop-up window; just close this. Then have them test out the clicker:
  * go forward: bottom button
  * go back: middle button
  * use laser pointer: top button
* Ask the student if they'd like to use the handheld mic or the headset, and help them get set up with whichever. (For the headset, have them put the box in their back pocket.) Take the other for yourself, so that you can make announcements or interruptions during the presentation if necessary
* Let the student know they can get started as soon as the gong goes off

## During student presentation

### 6:30pm (starting gong goes off)
Get the audience clapping/cheering for the student presenter. Then let the presenter do their thing and shine!

Interrupt if something clearly workplace inappropriate is said - it is the clearest way to set the expectation for what is acceptable. (This is why you need your mic!) E.g. Strong or frequent profanity, or any "-ism" (racism, sexism, disrespect toward a religion, etc.).

### 6:35pm (ending gong goes off)
If the student keeps talking and is not clearly about to end their talk, state into the mic that they are going into their two minutes of question time. This helps set the understanding for everyone that we are adhering to the 5-minute limit.

If the student is still talking at 6:36pm: Physically move so that you are standing next to them, so they understand to wrap up.

If the student is still talking at 6:37pm: They shouldn't be. Gently but firmly indicate that they need to finish immediately.

Whenever the student is finished, if there is still time, ask for questions from the audience until 6:37pm.

## After student presentation

* *If it's Friday:* Collect sign-ups for student presenters for the next week, Monday through Friday. As students volunteer, record them right away in the spreadsheet. First come first serve. Give priority to students who have not signed up yet, if you ever need to tie-break. (You can check the spreadsheet or simply ask.)
* Give announcements for the day (which class coordinators or other staff members may pass on to you throughout the day). Most of the time it's pretty chill and there is little to announce.
* Give a fun fact or joke if you wish, or a productivity tip, or just ask how people are doing. :) Keep it short and sweet and let them get back to hacking!

## After kickoff
* Write down the presentation's topic.

* *If it's Friday:* Update the "By student" sheet in the spreadsheet with everyone who you just signed up, so that there is an easy record of who has already gone. Then Slack each of the students who signed up with the following message: "Hey Chris! Confirmation that you will be presenting next Thursday (5/26), and remember to keep it to 5 minutes!"*
