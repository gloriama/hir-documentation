# Evening Kickoff

## Before student presentation

### 6:00pm (or any time during the day)

- [ ] *Optional:* Prepare a fun fact, joke, productivity tip, or anything else you'd like to share at kickoff. Make sure this stays short (definitely under 5 minutes), as we want evening kickoffs to be brief so that students can get back to coding!

### 6:15pm (or any time during dinner)

- [ ] Open the 5-Minute Presentations spreadsheet to see which student is presenting.

- [ ] Find the student and let them know to meet you at 6:25pm at the podium in the lecture area to get set up.

### 6:20pm

Set up the space:

- [ ] Turn on the three handheld mics and the headset mic. (For the headset mic, flick the switch so the green light turns on.) If any of the batteries are low or missing, let a Space Ops Associate know.

- [ ] Distribute two handheld mics to the audience (one in camping chairs, one at back tables), and keep the remaining handheld mic and the headset mic on the podium.

- [ ] Click the down arrow on the wall switch, to bring the projector screen down.

- [ ] Turn on the projector. (It's the little white remote, and just press the power button once.)

- [ ] Close all window blinds behind the projector AND across from the projector, by the senior tables.

- [ ] *If it's Friday:* Have the 5-Minute Presentations spreadsheet open on your laptop so you're ready to take sign-ups after the presentation.

### 6:25pm

Set the student up:

- [ ] Get the student's laptop plugged in, such that their slides show up on the projector screen. If this does not happen after about 30 seconds, make sure the black cord from the podium is fully plugged into the wall outlet. If this does not work and you need help troubleshooting, find a Space Ops Associate (or anyone else tech-savvy!) immediately to help you out.

- [ ] Offer the student the clicker/laser pointer, if they want it. If so, they have to plug in the USB piece to their computer. This will bring up a pop-up window; just close this. Then have them test out the clicker:
  * go forward: bottom button
  * go back: middle button
  * use laser pointer: top button

- [ ] Ask the student if they'd like to use the handheld mic or the headset, and help them get set up with whichever. (For the headset, have them put the box in their back pocket to prevent accidents.) Take the other mic for yourself, so that you can make announcements or interruptions during the presentation if necessary.

- [ ] Let the student know they can get started as soon as the gong goes off.

## During student presentation

### 6:30pm (starting gong goes off)
- [ ] Get the audience clapping/cheering for the student presenter. Then let the presenter do their thing and shine!

Interrupt if something clearly workplace-inappropriate is said, e.g. strong or frequent profanity, or any "-ism" (racism, sexism, disrespect toward a religion, and so on). This is the clearest way to set a standard of expectations for the entire audience.

### 6:35pm (ending gong goes off)
If the student keeps talking and is not clearly about to end their talk, state into the mic that they are going into their two minutes of question time. This helps set the understanding for everyone that we are adhering to the 5-minute limit.

*If the student is still talking at* ***6:36pm****:* Physically move so that you are standing next to them, so that they understand to wrap up.

*If the student is still talking at* ***6:37pm****:* They shouldn't be. Gently but firmly indicate that they need to finish immediately.

Whenever the student is finished, if there is still time, ask for questions from the audience until **6:37pm**.

## After student presentation

- [ ] *If it's Friday:* Collect sign-ups for student presenters for the next week, Monday through Friday. As students volunteer, record them right away in the 5-Minute Presentations spreadsheet. Sign-ups are first come first serve, but give priority to students who have not signed up yet. (If you are unsure who has gone already, you can check the spreadsheet, or simply ask the volunteers themselves.)

- [ ] Give any announcements for the evening (which class coordinators or other staff members may pass on to you throughout the day). Most of the time, it's pretty chill and there is little to announce.

- [ ] Tell a fun fact or joke if you wish, or a productivity tip, or just ask how people are doing. Keep it short and sweet and let them get back to hacking!

## After kickoff
- [ ] In the 5-Minute Presentations spreadsheet, record the presentation's topic.

- [ ] *If it's Friday:* Update the "By student" sheet (within the 5-Minute Presentations spreadsheet) with each of the newly signed-up students. This lets us easily check which students have already given presentations (and how many times each), for when the next sign-up day rolls around.

- [ ] *If it's Friday:* Slack message each of the newly signed-up students with something like: "Hey Chris! Confirmation that you will be presenting next Thursday (5/26), and remember to keep it to 5 minutes!"
