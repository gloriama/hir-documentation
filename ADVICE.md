## Top 5 pieces of advice

1. Build apps 30 minutes a day, and practice algorithms 30 minutes a day. This is deliberately a **modest but firm** goal.
1. Balance being an awesome HIR and doing your own learning.
1. Do not work for HR outside of your hours.
1. Set social boundaries with students.
1. Work in 3-week sprints. Pretend that's all the time you have before your job hunt to fill in your weak spots, and create a curriculum to cover the most pressing areas. Then repeat.

## Getting the most out of being a Hacker-in-Residence

This is a longer brain dump of thoughts and suggestions. These are things I either realized only partway through, or thought of early on but did not stick to (and wish that I had).

* Create an aspirational resume: a resume of things you’d like to accomplish by the end of your time as an HIR.

* Think seriously about the non-technical things you want to get out of the program. It might turn out that these are very secondary to your technical goals, or they might be super important, and either of those is fine. Just be aware of what you want, so that you can work toward it.

* Create a daily schedule, where you set aside consistent blocks of time to study/build your own stuff. Start by creating a schedule for your first week, and then reevaluate at the end of that week. Don’t be afraid to change it at any point in the program, if you realize it’s too rigorous/tiring or otherwise not serving you. Take care of yourself and adjust accordingly.

* (To expand on modest but firm daily goals:) The perfect is the enemy of the good. It’s cool to be ambitious with your time as an HIR, and you will naturally work very hard on stuff that you get interested in. But as a fail-safe for the less motivated times, set one or two small, accessible goals *that you commit to sticking to every day*. Don’t let yourself ever miss this two days in a row. The consistency will keep you from ever feeling totally lost.

* (To expand on social boundaries:) If you are interacting with students above and beyond the requirements of your duties and ever start to feel any social strain, absolutely feel free to set boundaries as needed. For example: Redirect students to other HIRs/resources if they ask you for technical help outside of your help desk hours. Do not respond to students on Facebook. Only respond to Slack messages during your shifts, and close it after work. Do whatever you need to do to make sure you have HR-free spaces in your life when you need them.

* (To expand on timeboxing HIR responsibilities:) Relatedly, do not work for HR outside of your hours. You deserve to be compensated fairly for your time, and the staff are totally with you on this. Bill for the time you spend writing your reports after admissions interviews, or putting in extra preparation for toy problem solution lectures. If you are unable to complete everything within your allotted hours, talk to Jocelyn (or whomever is appropriate) and let them know that something needs to be adjusted. This will save you from burn-out/resentment and protect your personal project time.

* Create the community you want. Plan an HIR lunch at the start of your HIRship, and another one to welcome the next HIRs. Eat lunch together. Form a system design study group with fellow HIRs. Reach out and make sure people are doing okay.

* Remember to be openly, confidently clueless. Ask questions. You are still learning. *The entire time you spent as a student here is literally just 1% of a 25-year career in software engineering.* There are no things that you "should already know" that it’s too late to ask about. Seriously. Just Ask It™.

### Ways to impress juniors
* Know their names like the back of your hand, before Day 1. (The Anki decks will help enormously in this.) Know their last names as well, and the other floor's students too.

* Memorize their project groups, and, if you have time, try to circulate around the groups early on in each project to get a sense of what each team is working on. (You can build a quick Anki deck to memorize these, too!) It's really nice to be able to say, "How’s Greenfield going? You’re working with ______ and ______, right?" and show the students that you are engaged with their experience.

* Make a spreadsheet for yourself to record who you’ve spoken to personally. Try to hit everyone in the first week or two, ideally to have a meaningful conversation with each person but at least to establish a relationship by introducing yourself or getting to know their personality a little bit. I literally used number codes to quantify this better (e.g. 1 for introduced myself, 2 for casual chat, 3 for extended personal conversation).

### Ways to encourage juniors
* Remember that Week 1 is super confusing for them, and they are still figuring out what to expect from HR: the staff, their fellow juniors, the seniors, the schedule, the pace, what weekly assessments are like, how likely it is they will be kicked out (i.e. very not likely, but they don’t know that yet). As recent grads, you are in the best position to reassure them about things they might be nervous about, or to simply provide a preview of what's to come. (They find this super helpful!) Just don’t give away any information that they shouldn’t have, e.g. assessment format/content. :)

* Never say that you hated a particular sprint. It does not really add any value and will likely only decrease their enthusiasm and openness toward enjoying the sprint themselves. Juniors take cues from you as to whether to frame a frustrating or challenging experience as "terrible"/"annoying" or "good for my learning"/"rewarding".

* Talk openly about difficulties you had throughout the course. Let them know they are not alone if they find something challenging.
