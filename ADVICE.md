## Getting the most out of being a Hacker-in-Residence

* Create an aspirational resume: a resume of things you’d like to accomplish by the end of your time as an HIR.

* Create a minimal version of the above - the absolute minimum you want to make sure you have done by the end of your 12 weeks.

* Take a moment to also think about and jot down the non-technical things you want to get out of the program. Depending on your goals, these might be pretty auxiliary to your technical goals, or super important, and either of those is fine. Just be aware what you really want to get out of this program, so that you can work toward it.

* Balance your interest in doing your duties well, and your interest in your own projects. Both are very rewarding, and you signed up because you are interested in both. That’s awesome. But make sure you don’t get sucked into one at the neglect of the other.

* Create a daily schedule for yourself, where you schedule in your time to study your own stuff. Start by creating a schedule for your first week, and then reevaluate at the end of that week. Don’t be afraid to change it at any point in the program, if you realize it’s too rigorous/tiring or otherwise not serving you. Take care of yourself and adjust accordingly. Remember that you’re just coming off 3 months of a 9am-8pm, 6-days-a-week routine - it’s totally reasonable for you to give yourself a slightly more forgiving schedule if you need it! (And DEFINITELY relax during your first Solo Week.)

* Create an "HIR curriculum" for yourself as well - topic(s) to learn each week, and then more granularly by day. The minimal aspirational resume you created above? Aim to knock it all out in the first three weeks, MVP/conjurer style. Start strong by covering the things you want to ensure you learn, at least in broad strokes. You can go back and learn it more deeply later after that first 3 week burst, and reevaluate/adjust your curriculum for the next 9 weeks if needed.

* The perfect is the enemy of the good. It’s cool to be ambitious with your time as an HIR, and you will work very hard on stuff that you get interested in. But as a failsafe for the less motivated times, set a small, accessible goal that you commit to sticking to every day of HIR, e.g. 30 minutes of toy problems and 30 minutes of app-building. Don’t let yourself ever miss this two days in a row. The consistency will keep you from ever feeling totally lost.

* If you are finding yourself very socially involved with students, make sure to set boundaries with students if you are starting to feel social strain. Do not answer help desk requests that do not come through help desk. Do not respond to students on Facebook. Only allow them to message you through Slack, and close it after work.

* Do not work for HR outside of your hours. I love HR and I’m sure you love HR, but HR also loves you and wants to make sure you are being compensated fairly for your time. Bill for the time you spend writing your reports after admissions interviews, or putting in extra preparation for toy problem solution lectures. If you are unable to complete your responsibilities for HR in the 34 hours allotted to duties, talk to Jocelyn (or whomever is appropriate) and let them know that something needs to be adjusted. Timebox, timebox, timebox: When you’re working for HR, do awesome work for HR. When you’re not, don’t lift a finger. This will save you from burn-out in the long run and make everything better for everyone.

* Create the community you want. Plan an HIR lunch at the start of your HIRship, and another one to welcome the next HIRs. Eat lunch together. Form a system design study group with fellow HIRs. Reach out and make sure people are doing okay.

* Remember to be openly, confidently clueless. Ask questions. You are still learning. There are not things you "should already know" that it’s too late to ask about. (Seriously. In the scheme of things, we are all still software engineering fetuses.) Just Ask It™.

## Ways to Impress Juniors
* Know their names. Know them like the back of your hand, before Day 1. Know their last names as well.
* Memorize their Greenfield groups, and try to get a sense of what each group is working on, if you have time. You can build a quick Anki deck for these too. Being able to say "How’s Greenfield going? You’re working with ______ and ______, right?" is really nice.
* Make a spreadsheet for yourself where you mark down who you’ve spoken to personally. Try to hit everyone in the first week or two. Definitely always go for quality over quantity, but this for me just helped make sure I at least did cover everyone and establish a bit of a personal relationship with each student.

## Ways to Encourage Juniors
* Remember that Week 1 is super confusing for them, and they are still figuring out what to expect from HR: staff, fellow juniors, the seniors, the schedule, the pace, what weekly assessments are like, how likely it is they will be kicked out (i.e. very not likely, but they don’t know that yet), everything. You can totally provide a preview of, or reassurance about, anything they might be nervous about or just have no clue about - just don’t give away any information that they shouldn’t have (e.g. assessment format/content). :)

* Talk openly about difficulties you had throughout the course. Let them know they are not alone if they find something challenging.
